      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p class = "content">
        Currently finishing my studies at Boston University as a Neuroscience major. Since Neuroscience is a discipline strongly
        correlated with Computer Science, my interest in programming began when I took a "Comptational Neuroscience" course using 
        Matlab. In order to strengthen my knowledge in computer science, I'm currently taking an intensive "Introduction to 
        Computer Science" course that teaches programming in Python. In addition, I've taken various courses on Codecademy and
        I'm using the skills I've learned in Github to create projects and demonstrate the span of my technical abilities.
      </p>
      <p class = "content">
        After graduating from Boston University in May, I'd like to become a strong contributer to a health care technology
        company, where I can develop the skills to eventually create my own diagnostic tool that can effectively diagnose 
        neurodegenerative diseases.
